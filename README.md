# Libft - 42 School Education Project


Libft is a fundamental educational project at 42 School, designed to help you strengthen your C programming skills by creating your own library of essential functions. This README will guide you through the project, its purpose, structure, and how to use it to enhance your future 42 School projects.

## Project Description

In the world of C programming, libraries are your best friends. Libft challenges you to build your very own library containing a collection of functions commonly used in various C projects. These functions will serve as your personal toolbox, making it easier to tackle future 42 School projects by providing reusable, well-implemented building blocks.

The Libft project is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1**: Reimplementation of standard C library functions, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `isdigit`, and many more.
2. **Part 2**: Additional functions that are not part of the standard C library but are commonly used in programming, like linked list manipulation, string manipulation, and more.

For detailed project specifications and requirements, please refer to the [Libft Project Subject](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/5838/libft.en.pdf).

## Why Libft is Important

- **Skill Building**: Building your library from scratch is an excellent opportunity to gain a deep understanding of C programming and the inner workings of common functions.
- **Reusability**: You can use your custom library in all your future 42 School projects, saving you time and effort.
- **Project Prerequisites**: Many 42 School projects require you to use your Libft functions as a prerequisite, making it a vital project for your 42 journey.
- **Validation**: Successfully completing the Libft project is often the first major milestone in your 42 School curriculum.

## Project Structure

The Libft project has a straightforward structure:

- **Source Files**: The project contains both `.c` and `.h` files in the main directory, including the Makefile.
- **Bonus Functions**: All bonus functions are included alongside the mandatory functions in the main directory.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Libft project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Libft repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oboualla/libft.git
```

2. Navigate to the Libft directory.

```bash
cd libft
```

3. Build your library using the provided Makefile.

```bash
make
```

4. Now, you can use your custom functions in your other 42 School projects by including the appropriate header files and linking to your library.

## License

This project is typically not licensed as it's meant for educational purposes within the 42 School curriculum.
